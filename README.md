### Bioinformatics Research

Learning bioinformatics usually requires solving computational problems of varying difficulty that are extracted from real challenges of molecular biology.

To make learning bioinformatics fun and easy, I am using Rosalind, a platform for learning bioinformatics through problem solving.
